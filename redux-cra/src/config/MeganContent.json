      "paragraph-main-1": "For the summer of 2017, I interned at Blackbaud, a software development company based in Charleston, SC. Blackbaud develops software products for non-profits, higher education, and healthcare - some of their clients include awesome organizations like Habitat for Humanity, the World Wildlife Fund, and Feeding America.",
      "paragraph-main-2": "The team I worked on is called Monopoly; it is a smaller subset of the Enterprise Team. One of Enterprise's main products is the Constituent Relationship Manager (CRM) product which is used by extremely large organizations such as the University of Michigan and the Children's Hospital Colorado Foundation. These clients use CRM to manage their constituent database and take care of the important things such as fundraising and general ledger tasks.",
      "paragraph-main-3": "Blackbaud's CRM is a very large product and, at that time, could not yet be a part of Blackbaud's goal of 'One Blackbaud', where all products are integrated cloud-based services that can be somewhat modularized. The product managers, however, wanted a responsive, mobile-friendly web app to give to fundraisers for CRM that would enable them to go out and fundraise without being stuck lugging around their computers.",
      "paragraph-main-4": "So Fundraiser on the Go was born! It has a very visually appealing, easy-to-use interface and allows an organizations' fundraisers to track steps and communication with a prospect's plan, any monetary gifts given, and to find a prospect's contact information quickly. The goal for my software engineering internship was to develop new features for Fundraiser on the Go. By the end of the summer, I had filed a report and fixed a bug, written, tested, and checked in code for 4 new features for the application! Clients will be seeing these new features when they get the sprint package update in a month or so!",

All the clients that we work with are so incredible and it was very rewarding receiving client feedback and hearing how happy they were with new features or updates.",
      "paragraph-volunteering-2": "Blackbaud's internship program not only takes us to local clients to hear about their causes and receive feedback on company products, but also to volunteer and help for a few hours.

      "paragraph-frog-2": "Above are some features that I added to the app. I worked on a wonderful team with a product manager, program manager, user experience designer, software quality engineer, and many more other roles. While I was the developer for these features, in no way do I feel like I did everything myself. We used Agile software development practices, so our team met daily for our 15 minute stand up in order to keep track of what the team was up to. We used back-logs and task management tools and also had a great many options for communication amongst team members: Slack, Skype, WebEx.",
      "paragraph-frog-3": "As a team, we called the client to 'discover' what they wanted features to look like and how they wanted them to perform. We discussed how features would work as a group, and I worked closely with the UX designer to make sure everything was functioning as planned. Unit tests were written for any new code added and then I would submit my code for a code review with my team.",
      "paragraph-frog-4": "Most of the time, the feedback I received was from a Senior Software Engineer who probably taught me more about databases, data lists, code tables, SQL, and C# in one summer than I could have learned in a year of school. It was awesome! I really enjoyed learning full stack development and I had never taken a database class before so it was great seeing the full process all the way through. I also enjoyed having someone keep me on my toes with regards to production quality programming.",
