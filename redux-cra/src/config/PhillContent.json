        "paragraph-main-2": "The team I worked on is called Monopoly; it is a smaller subset of the Enterprise Team. One of Enterprise's main products is the Constituent Relationship Manager (CRM) product which is used by extremely large organizations such as the University of Michigan and the Children's Hospital Colorado Foundation. These clients use CRM to manage their constituent database and take care of the important things such as fundraising and general ledger tasks.",
        "paragraph-main-3": "Blackbaud's CRM is a very large product and, at that time, could not yet be a part of Blackbaud's goal of 'One Blackbaud', where all products are integrated cloud-based services that can be somewhat modularized. The product managers, however, wanted a responsive, mobile-friendly web app to give to fundraisers for CRM that would enable them to go out and fundraise without being stuck lugging around their computers.",

It has a very visually appealing, easy-to-use interface and allows an organizations' fundraisers to track steps and communication with a prospect's plan, any monetary gifts given, and to find a prospect's contact information quickly. The goal for my software engineering internship was to develop new features for Fundraiser on the Go. By the end of the summer, I had filed a report and fixed a bug, written, tested, and checked in code for 4 new features for the application! Clients will be seeing these new features when they get the sprint package update in a month or so!",

We used Agile software development practices, so our team met daily for our 15 minute stand up in order to keep track of what the team was up to.

Unit tests were written for any new code added and then I would submit my code for a code review with my team.",
