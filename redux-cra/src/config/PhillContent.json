The web app had to maintain records and allow for user interaction and manipulation in a variety of different ways. The site used a traditional MVC pattern and I wrote most of it in HTML/CSS, bootstrap, javascript, PHP, and hosted the SQL style database on siteground.",

There is a tool called nexus that tracks client data and services for families that come in and make arrangements for end of life services. I modeled my system of off this idea and was able to create the GraveDigger Database Tool.",
