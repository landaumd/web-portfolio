I pushed myself way outside of my comfort zone and was rewarded in memories, friends, and experiences that I will hold dear for the rest of my life. I ended up going to school in Florence to become and english instructor and then moved to Bologna afterwards to teach english for a business school that had clients all throughout the region."

If we ask the question, “given all the combinations of choices one can make in a given domain, what is the best path to reach a certain goal?” In other words, what actions can I take to make it more likely that I accomplish a goal or reach a certain outcome? We build a model in python and use django framework to build a web application to host and test using a custom built set of data. In our internal testing we imagined a set of patient records from a hospital and we wanted a certain outcome with respect to an illness. Action rules could be used to tell us what medicine, in what dosage, with other factors could get us to a better health level. The paper was written and we are waiting on an appropriate set of test data to continue forward with the publishing of the paper.",
